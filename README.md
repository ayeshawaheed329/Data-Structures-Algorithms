## Introduction

This repository contains Java implementations of commonly used data structures and algorithms. Each implementation includes explanations, comments, and example use cases to help you understand the concepts and improve your programming skills.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a resource for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms in Java.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following main folders:

- **`src/`**
    - **`algorithms/`**: Contains the source code for basic algorithms using data structures.
    - **`problems/`**: Provides solutions to algorithmic problems.

## Problems

Explore solutions to algorithmic problems from LeetCode or any other open source platform. The `problems/` directory contains Java solutions along with explanations and comments.
